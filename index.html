        <p> I'm making this personal website as part of my software development course
          with the Flatiron School. It might seem a little crazy for a while, but it gives
          me a chance to practice the things I've learned. We've got ourselves a "Hello World," 
          a snippet added through JavaScript, and more to come!

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jonathan Moore, and I'm currently a student in the Flex Software Development
          program at the Flatiron School. In addition to my job as a student, I am also a Legal Analyst
          at the law firm Korein Tillery in Chicago. I also perform as a freelancer on viola, playing both
          in Chicago and as far afield as Mobile, AL!
        </p>
        <p>I'm from Mobile and went to school in Cincinnati, earning a Bachelor's and Master's degree at UC's
          College-Conservatory of Music. I moved to Chicago in 2017 and haven't really looked back!
        </p>
        <p>In addition to working my day job, learning to code, and playing music, there are a bunch of other things
          I like doing! I go climbing, I swim in Lake Michigan, I play with my cat, I read fun books, I somehow
          still play Pokemon Go (although maybe I should stop), I cook, and many more!
